HOWTO
=====

First, you have to know there are several boards supported by the software.
Those boards use a chip to translate from USB to JTAG commands. The chip is
called stlink and there are 2 versions:
. STLINKv1, present on STM32VL discovery kits,
. STLINKv2, present on STM32L discovery and later kits.

2 different transport layers are used:
. STLINKv1 uses SCSI passthru commands over USB,
. STLINKv2 uses raw USB commands.

Common requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. libusb-1.0  (You probably already have this, but you'll need the
development version to compile)
. pkg-config

IF YOU HAVE AN STLINKv1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The STLINKv1's SCSI emulation is very broken, so the best thing to do
is tell your operating system to completely ignore it.

Options (do one of these before you plug it in)
   *) modprobe -r usb-storage && modprobe usb-storage quirks=483:3744:i
or *)1. add "options usb-storage quirks=483:3744:i" to /etc/modprobe.conf
   *)2. modprobe -r usb-storage && modprobe usb-storage
or *)1. cp stlink_v1.modprobe.conf /etc/modprobe.d
   *)2. modprobe -r usb-storage && modprobe usb-storage

IF YOU HAVE AN STLINKv2
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You're ready to go :)

COMPILING
~~~~~~~~~
This project was converted to Autotools by a well meaning individual. The
following steps will build the project for you.

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make

USING THE GDBSERVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To run the gdb server: (you do not need sudo if you have set up
permissions correctly)

$ make && [sudo] ./st-util

There are a few options:

./st-util - usage:

  -h, --help		Print this help
  -vXX, --verbose=XX	Specify a specific verbosity level (0..99)
  -v, --verbose		Specify generally verbose logging
  -s X, --stlink_version=X
			Choose what version of stlink to use, (defaults to 2)
  -1, --stlinkv1	Force stlink version 1
  -p 4242, --listen_port=1234
			Set the gdb server listen port. (default port: 4242)
  -m, --multi
			Set gdb server to extended mode.
			st-util will continue listening for connections after disconnect.
  -n, --no-reset
			Do not reset board on connection.

The STLINKv2 device to use can be specified in the environment
variable STLINK_DEVICE on the format <USB_BUS>:<USB_ADDR>.

Then, in your project directory, someting like this...
(remember, you need to run an _ARM_ gdb, not an x86 gdb)

$ arm-none-eabi-gdb fancyblink.elf
...
(gdb) tar extended-remote :4242
...
(gdb) load
Loading section .text, size 0x458 lma 0x8000000
Loading section .data, size 0x8 lma 0x8000458
Start address 0x80001c1, load size 1120
Transfer rate: 1 KB/sec, 560 bytes/write.
(gdb)
...
(gdb) continue

Have fun!

Resetting the chip from GDB
===========================

You may reset the chip using GDB if you want. You'll need to use `target
extended-remote' command like in this session:
(gdb) target extended-remote localhost:4242
Remote debugging using localhost:4242
0x080007a8 in _startup ()
(gdb) kill
Kill the program being debugged? (y or n) y
(gdb) run
Starting program: /home/whitequark/ST/apps/bally/firmware.elf 

Remember that you can shorten the commands. `tar ext :4242' is good enough
for GDB.

Setting up udev rules
=====================

For convenience, you may install udev rules file, 49-stlinkv*.rules, located
in the root of repository. You will need to copy it to /etc/udev/rules.d,
and then either reboot or execute
$ udevadm control --reload-rules
$ udevadm trigger

Udev will now create a /dev/stlinkv2_XX or /dev/stlinkv1_XX file, with the appropriate permissions.
This is currently all the device is for, (only one stlink of each version is supported at 
any time presently)

Running programs from SRAM
==========================

You can run your firmware directly from SRAM if you want to. Just link
it at 0x20000000 and do
(gdb) load firmware.elf

It will be loaded, and pc will be adjusted to point to start of the
code, if it is linked correctly (i.e. ELF has correct entry point).

Writing to flash
================

The GDB stub ships with a correct memory map, including the flash area.
If you would link your executable to 0x08000000 and then do
(gdb) load firmware.elf
then it would be written to the memory.


FAQ
===

Q: My breakpoints do not work at all or only work once.

A: Optimizations can cause severe instruction reordering. For example,
if you are doing something like `REG = 0x100;' in a loop, the code may
be split into two parts: loading 0x100 into some intermediate register
and moving that value to REG. When you set up a breakpoint, GDB will
hook to the first instruction, which may be called only once if there are
enough unused registers. In my experience, -O3 causes that frequently.

Q: At some point I use GDB command `next', and it hangs.

A: Sometimes when you will try to use GDB `next' command to skip a loop,
it will use a rather inefficient single-stepping way of doing that.
Set up a breakpoint manually in that case and do `continue'.
