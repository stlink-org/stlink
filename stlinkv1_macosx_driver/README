Hi,

i managed to get the stlink v1 working under os x and i would like to share the solution so maybe you can
add it in your package.
The problem is that os x claims the device as scsi and libusb won't be able to connect to it.
I've created what is called a codeless driver which claims the device and has a higher priority then the
default apple mass storage driver, so the device can be accessed through libusb.

I tested this codeless driver under OS X 10.6.8 and 10.7.2. I assume it works with any 10.6.x and 10.7.x
version as well.

Attached to this mail you'll find the osx folder with the source code of the driver, both drivers (for
10.6.x and 10.7.x). no reboot required.

== Update 4.1.2012 Fritz ==

I changed the installation from the install.sh script to standard package which I made with the "PackageMaker" tool
(standard in the MacOS Development). 

The packagemaker expects the kernel extensions for 10.6 and 10.7 in the Release Directory. So you need
to build the Extensions with the XCode Environment, then build the package with the packagemaker. 

If you do not want to do that you can simply install the package by double-clicking from the finder..
